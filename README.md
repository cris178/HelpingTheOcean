# HelpingTheOcean
A simple Android game created by students of Longfellow Elementry School in Riverside CA.

TLDR: I mentored a group of students as part of a mentorship program called AppJam+ by Dreams for Schools. In the span of 7 weeks students used a programming platform called Thunkable which consists of a block based programming language really similar to Scratch. The theme of this years program is helping mother nature. Our team made an app that would help bring awareness to pollutted waters. Help the fish that have been affected by the plastic in the ocean.

Dreams for Schools oversees programs and initiatives that contribute to educating youth about Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) fields. The main outreach program of the organization is the AppJam+ initiative. AppJam+ is a program that takes the concept of building software in a short period of time as a tool to excite and inform middle school students about STEM fields while teaching them the creative and hands-on technical process of mobile application development. Middle school students receive mentorship from college undergraduates and learn to make Mobile apps, which will be utilized by a K-12 audience.
